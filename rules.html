		<header>Sabotage / Griefing</header>
	    <br>
			<section>Sabotage is an action that can impact your opponents gameplay for the worse; a forfeit can only be issued if it directly effects the outcome of the match</section>
	    <br>
			<section>When in your opponent's vehicle, you are agreeing to any actions taken by the driver of the vehicle.</section>
			<section>This includes, but is not limited to, flying out of the safe zone, flying into a building, and jumping out of the vehicle.</section>
			<section>Do not excessively ping for no reason in order to keep your opponent from hearing things.</section>
			<section>In order for sabotage to occur, you must have had a chance to win mathematically.</section>
			<section>Shooting for no reason on your opponents location.</section>
			<section>Shooting your opponents balloon or zipline (must actively be using the zip to be considered sabotage if it gets destroyed)</section>
	    		<section>There are many more forms of sabotage, we cannot list them all. We suggest to stay far away from your opponents to avoid issues.</section>
	      		</section>

		<header>Restricted Items</header>
			<section>Gulag Kit</section>
			<section>Redeploy Kit</section>
			<section>Reinforcement Flare</section>
			<section>The Heavy Helicopter</section>
			<section>If you pick up a restricted item on accident, you must either lose your gulag and/or down yourself upon respawning.</section>
			</section>
	    		<section>
		<header>Killing AFKs</header>
			<section>Waiting until the end of the plane line to kill the AFK players is not allowed. If you believe your opponent is doing this, it is your responsibility to provide proof.</section>
			<section>It is at the discretion of the admin on if a replay or forfeit would be issues due to this.</section>

			<section>Once all members of your team are fully dead, meaning they do not have gulag anymore, that is their final score for the game. </section>
			<section>We suggest getting proof of the score once your opponents are dead in case a jailbreak occurs.</section>
			<section>If both members of your team are dead and a jailbreak occurs, you will be required to immediately down yourself by hitting the ground from the respawn.</section>
			<section>(Note: floating with your parachute is strictly prohibited)</section>
			<section>If you attempt to get kills after a jailbreak when your team is fully dead, you will risk forfeiting.</section>
